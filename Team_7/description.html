                                        The banker’s algorithm is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm that tests for safety by simulating the allocation for predetermined maximum possible amounts of all resources, then makes an “s-state” check to test for possible activities, before deciding whether allocation should be allowed to continue.
                                        Banker’s algorithm is named so because it is used in banking system to check whether loan can be sanctioned to a person or not. Suppose there are n number of account holders in a bank and the total sum of their money is S. If a person applies for a loan then the bank first subtracts the loan amount from the total money that bank has and if the remaining amount is greater than S then only the loan is sanctioned. It is done because if all the account holders comes to withdraw their money then the bank can easily do it.
                                        In other words, the bank would never allocate its money in such a way that it can no longer satisfy the needs of all its customers. The bank would try to be in safe state always.</p>

This is a busy waiting solution which can be used for more than two processes. In this mechanism, a Lock variable lockis used. Two values of lock can be possible, either 0 or 1. Lock value 0 means that the critical section is vacant while the lock value 1 means that it is occupied. A process which wants to get into the critical section first checks the value of the lock variable. If it is 0 then it sets the value of lock as 1 and enters into the critical section, otherwise it waits.</p>

                                        There are the scenarios in which more than one processes need to execute in critical section simultaneously. However, counting semaphore can be used when we need to have more than one process in the critical section at the same time. The programming code of semaphore implementation is shown below which includes the structure of semaphore and the logic using which the entry and the exit can be performed in the critical section.</p>

                                        To get rid of the problem of wasting the wake-up signals, Dijkstra proposed an approach which involves storing all the wake-up calls. Dijkstra states that, instead of giving the wake-up calls directly to the consumer, producer can store the wake-up call in a variable. Any of the consumers can read it whenever it needs to do so. Semaphore is the variables which storesthe entire wake up calls that are being transferred from producer to consumer. It is a variable on which read, modify and update happens automatically in kernel mode. Semaphore cannot be implemented in the user mode because race condition may always arise when two or more processes try to access the variable simultaneously. It always needs support from the operating system to be implemented.

                                        In counting semaphore, Mutual exclusion was not provided because we has the set of processes which required to execute in the critical section simultaneously. However, Binary Semaphore strictly provides mutual exclusion. Here, instead of having more than 1 slots available in the critical section, we can only have at most 1 process in the critical section. The semaphore can have only two values, 0 or 1. Let's see the programming implementation of Binary Semaphore.</p>
